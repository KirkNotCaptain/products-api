//skus contain 27 million entries and are too large to combine into our style-photo collection. 
//they will be kept in their separate collection (and will be queueried separately by the API)
//detailed below is the basic restructuring to group them by the style_id

//result data will have this structure:

        id: "..." (sku id),
        size: "...",
        quantity: "..."
        },
        {
            "..." more skus for the above style id
        }
    ]
}


$group: {
  _id: "$ styleId",
